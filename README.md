I'm an undergraduate Physics student at the University of York with a keen interest in Computer Science.
I have been a member of the computing team at the University of York's Student Television Station (YSTV) since 2021 and hold the position of Website Coordinator.
I am also the Head of Computing at the UK's oldest legal independent radio station, the University of York's Student Radio Station (URY).

My main expertise is python, bash, html and PowerShell but I like to dable in anything.
Firm believer in containerisation.
