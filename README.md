I'm an undergraduate Physics student at the University of York with a keen interest in Computer Science.
I have been a member of the computing team at the University of York's Student Television Station (YSTV) since 2021 and held the position of Website Coordinator.
I was also the Head of Computing at the UK's oldest legal independent radio station, the University of York's Student Radio Station (URY) and now hold the position of Assistant Head of Computing.

My main expertise is python, bash, html, SQL and PowerShell but I like to dable in anything.
Firm believer in containerisation.
